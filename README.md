N.A.T.’s software defined radio (SDR) unit, the NAT-AMC-ZYNQUP-SDR, is a unified development platform in a ready-to-deploy format, that combines best-in-class hardware with a tailored, comprehensive software package.

This flexible SDR platform in the AMC from factor targets wireless applications that require a scalable number of phase-coherent antennas. It supports four or eight RF channels, defined by the number of stacked FMC mezzanine cards.

The synchronization of multiple SDR boards enables you to create large antenna arrays with RF phase-coherent radio channels, i.e. up to 48 RF channels in s single 2U 19” rack space.

The unique combination of an all-programmable Xilinx® Zynq® UltraScale+™ FPGA with integrated quad-core ARM® processor and the ADRV9009 RF-front end from the latest Analog Devices family of RF devices make the NAT-AMC-ZYNQUP-SDR the ideal platform for the wireless communications system architect seeking a unified development platform in a ready-to-deploy package which operates over a wide RF tuning range from 75MHz to 6GHz on up to 8 phase synchronous RF interfaces and a maximum channel bandwidth of 200MHz.

Further features such as observation channels for Digital-Pre-Distortion (DPD) and flexible I/O i.e. for control of external PAs allow solutions for advanced applications.
